    At TRW I quickly moved from a management trainee role in to technology. In the latter part of my tenure at TRW I participated in a full lifecycle development project for the DoD and led a team to develop the reporting capability for a new application. At Transarc I began my experience with middleware, the OSF Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) and Kerberos.
