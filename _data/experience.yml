    Member of a small team that has pioneered the design, implementation and use of container technologies in the organization.
    
    Beginning with Docker Swarm in 2017, we moved to Kubernetes and have built the platform on which the enterprise can deploy and maintain applications in Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and other Kubernetes environments.
